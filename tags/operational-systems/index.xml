      <description>&lt;p&gt;Awk was created as a way to manipulate data easily because if you wanted to make some manipulation before, you had to create entire programs in C. As we know C isn&amp;rsquo;t the most complete language, it is really dry in the default library, which means that it would take a lot of time even for something simple, from that inconvenience that amazing tool was born.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;not-just-a-tool-but-a-programming-language-by-itself&#34;&gt;Not Just a Tool But a Programming Language By Itself&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can have files named &lt;code&gt;something.awk&lt;/code&gt; and it would be taken by the awk program and used to parse the input files, not to mention the possibility to create functions, having for loops and a great regex system.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;It considers the data from columns, you have the possibility to modify the separators and pretty much everything. Example of a function in awk:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
