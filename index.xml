      <description>&lt;p&gt;I came from a background of python/golang programming, my first contact with programming was with python, then I studied C to get to know systems programming and understand better about memory with pointers&amp;hellip; golang was kind of my favorite language during a lot of time, because it has a simple and direct syntax with some built in niceties like map or slices (which in C must be done manually).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However after some time I got kinda bored, the tools were amazing but I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel the ecstasy of exploring new features or syntax, I had heard about lisp before, although I disregarded it because I thought it was esoteric (which was synonym of uselessly complex and hard) to do things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Salut, ça va? I am a brazilian IT professional with love and care about what I do, mostly developing OS tools and web apps casually to make my life better and professionally to serve businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I love to explore new concepts and to build my own things, it also means I need to know how to handle both the presentation and infrastructure to make my application running, if it is web, that is it. During this journey I experienced different areas, although not much in pentesting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
