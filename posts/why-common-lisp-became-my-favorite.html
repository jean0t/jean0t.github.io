<p>However after some time I got kinda bored, the tools were amazing but I didn't feel the ecstasy of exploring new features or syntax, I had heard about lisp before, although I disregarded it because I thought it was esoteric (which was synonym of uselessly complex and hard) to do things.  </p>

<p>Some hours with it proved me how wrong I was...  </p>

<h4>Why it is so good?</h4>

<p>As previously menitoned, I like simple and direct languages, but I also love to explore new syntaxes and ways of working. Lisp is a definition, which means a lot of 'dialects' of it exist, each with its functions, modules and uses.<br/>
However that is one of its best features and how it shiny: the previsibility and stability. Its syntax is the same, no matter the dialect you will always have the basic:<br/>
<code>
(function arg1 arg2 ... argN)
</code>  </p>

<p>What will change is the underlying implementation, like being case sensitive or separating the namespace of functions and arguments.<br/>
Another aspect that made me think it is magical is it pragmaticality, its debug is powerful, we can change variables and functions while it is <strong>still</strong> executing!!!<br/>
Related to this interactive debug comes the fact lisp is interpreted, but forget your concept about slow languages like python/ruby or memory eater like javascript, Lisp is fast, lightweight and offers compilation, sometimes native compilation binary depending on the lisp implementation you are using.<br/>
Famous versions of lisp are: emacs lisp, lisp flavored erlang, clojure, common lisp, scheme, guile, etc.  </p>

<p>And I didn't even mentioned the powerful system of macros that can literally implement new paradigms to the language.</p>

<h5>Common lisp is reliable, powerful, fast, dynamic, customizable and multiple. Just choose the version you love and dive in.</h5>
