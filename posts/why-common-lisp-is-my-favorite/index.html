          <p>I came from a background of python/golang programming, my first contact with programming was with python, then I studied C to get to know systems programming and understand better about memory with pointers&hellip; golang was kind of my favorite language during a lot of time, because it has a simple and direct syntax with some built in niceties like map or slices (which in C must be done manually).</p>
<p>However after some time I got kinda bored, the tools were amazing but I didn&rsquo;t feel the ecstasy of exploring new features or syntax, I had heard about lisp before, although I disregarded it because I thought it was esoteric (which was synonym of uselessly complex and hard) to do things.</p>
<p>Some hours with it proved me how wrong I was&hellip;</p>
<h4 id="why-it-is-so-good">Why it is so good?</h4>
<p>As previously menitoned, I like simple and direct languages, but I also love to explore new syntaxes and ways of working. Lisp is a definition, which means a lot of &lsquo;dialects&rsquo; of it exist, each with its functions, modules and uses.<br>
However that is one of its best features and how it shiny: the previsibility and stability. Its syntax is the same, no matter the dialect you will always have the basic:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>(function arg1 arg2 ... argN)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>What will change is the underlying implementation, like being case sensitive or separating the namespace of functions and arguments.<br>
Another aspect that made me think it is magical is it pragmaticality, its debug is powerful, we can change variables and functions while it is <strong>still</strong> executing!!!<br>
Related to this interactive debug comes the fact lisp is interpreted, but forget your concept about slow languages like python/ruby or memory eater like javascript, Lisp is fast, lightweight and offers compilation, sometimes native compilation binary depending on the lisp implementation you are using.<br>
Famous versions of lisp are: emacs lisp, lisp flavored erlang, clojure, common lisp, scheme, guile, etc.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t even mentioned the powerful system of macros that can literally implement new paradigms to the language.</p>
<h5 id="common-lisp-is-reliable-powerful-fast-dynamic-customizable-and-multiple-just-choose-the-version-you-love-and-dive-in">Common lisp is reliable, powerful, fast, dynamic, customizable and multiple. Just choose the version you love and dive in.</h5>
